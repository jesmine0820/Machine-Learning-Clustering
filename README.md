# Machine-Learning-Clustering

This is my BMCS2114 Machine Learning Assignment.
Our topics is text clustering on sustainability related documents.
The dataset that we found is from Kaggle > https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beridzeg45/guardian-environment-related-news

My module is training the data by using Fuzzy C Means and Gaussian Mixture Model.
I also deploy the model for interative use.
